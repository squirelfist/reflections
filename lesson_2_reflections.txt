What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git creates the .git folder and establishes the current directory 
as a Git Repository
-Git does not, however, create a commit for you automatically
you have to make the first commit yourself
-you need to do it to et Git know that the directory should be treated as
a repository and to enable version control and commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-the staging area is a (possibly logical) contruct that houses the files in the working directory
that are meant to be added to a repository using a commit
-it is of benefit as it allows greater control and flexibility when choosing which files constitute a logical change
and thus are eligible to be grouped together as a commit; rather than simply adding all files all the time
