What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git creates the .git folder and establishes the current directory 
as a Git Repository
-Git does not, however, create a commit for you automatically
you have to make the first commit yourself
-you need to do it to et Git know that the directory should be treated as
a repository and to enable version control and commits
